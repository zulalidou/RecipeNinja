The purpose of this document is to contain a list of things to work on for foodconnoisseur.
The things I need to do include (but are not limited to):



RECOMMENDED RECIPES

Sometimes when I look at detailed info about a recipe, I get that same recipe as a recommendation at the bottom

CLEAN THE CODE

Make the code more organized, and make sure you understand every single part. If you can’t explain it in simple words, then you don’t understand it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SEARCH RESULTS

Make it so that when users look up some type of food, that food EXACTLY is what shows up, and not foods that contain the search term in them

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONTACT FORM

Add a contact form

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LOADING

Consider adding the loading circle when retrieving recipes
